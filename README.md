A simple package demonstrating possible techniques for building on top of [_Lightweaver_](https://github.com/Goobley/Lightweaver), but also helping to bridge the gap between chromospheric NLTE Radiative Transfer codes and those designed for isolated irradiated structures, such as prominences and filaments.
The two main models: `IsoPromModel` and `PctrPromModel` are built on the ideas presented in the PROM codes [citation needed].

### Documentation

The documentation for Promweaver can be found [here](https://goobley.github.io/Promweaver).

### Acknowledgements

Many thanks for Jack Jenkins and Nic Labrosse for discussing the ideas and implementation of the techniques used in this package.
